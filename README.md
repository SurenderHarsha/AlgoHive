# Algohive
## Crowdsourcing cryptocurrency prediction algorithms.
Project Algohive's mission is to share the best projects on cryptocurrency price prediction and leverage the power of the crowd to make them better. The projects listed here are all members of the AlgoHive Project, a [community](https://algohive.com/) of data scientists, machine learning experts, crypto traders, financial analysts, angel investors and all-around hackers that are working together to help make cryptocurrency trading safeer, smarter and easier.

> *We love algorithms, crypto, machine learning and AI and work together to ultimately develop the most predictive cryptocurrency algorithm in the world.*

This includes:

* Social sentiment data
* Google Trends
* CCXT Library
* GitHub data
* Reddit data
* Deep learning models
* ...more data sources added weekly

## What's in it for you:

- Get free advice from our community of members that live and breath algorithms, data science, machine laerning and the latest techniques in crypto trading and analysis.
- Learn about the benefits of cryptocurrency trading, trade automation and bot creation, and other smart programmatic ways to put your trading on autopilot.
- Full transparency into how we build crypto trading algorithms and bots, all of our research, field testing, expert analyses and yes, even failures (because we're all here to learn)! ðŸš€

## How to contribute:
1) Join our free [Telegram group](https://t.me/algohive) (100+ members from all over the world)

2) Share this repository link with others who think that this is cool project to be a part of.

3) Fork this repository to add other great crypto prediction projects to our master list.

## Why is this free?
After creating my original [Bitcoin trading formula](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-created-a-bitcoin-trading-algorithm-with-a-29-return-rate-using-sentiment-analysis-b0db0e777f4) that generated a 29% return using Google Trends sentiment analysis I shared  with the crypto community the response was overwhelming. So many others wanted to learn how to be smarter about crypto trading. After many many conversations with other traders and data experts I discovered that many of us we trying to solve the same problem. This led me to build a collabortive platform to bring other great crypto minds together and launch the AlgoHive project and community.

This is free because this is the resource that I would have loved to have years ago but unfortunately I needed to learn it all myself, make many costly mistakes and had no one to share the successes with. I believe that information should be free, boarderless and available to all.

## Who's paying for all of this?
Although this is mostly a collaborative approach all the expenses of research, web development, web hosting, community management, developing and testing new algorithms, finding data sources I pay for out-of-pocket. While I want to forward the crypto movement the only way that this will be sustainable for now is via donations.

To that end I am creating an AlgoHive public wallet in which can be publicly viewed by anyone. While a portion of funds will be used for expenses the majority will be used exclusively on growing this community and project--and financing the most promising projects. Anyone will be able to see real-time any funds used. Eventually I will set project goals to crowdfund further development based on the donations that we receive. 

(I am open to any other ideas that can ensure that these donations are transparent and safe--please shoot me a note on [Telegram] (https://t.me/directbus).
