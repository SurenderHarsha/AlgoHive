# Algohive
## Crowdsourcing cryptocurrency prediction algorithms.
Project AlgoHive's mission is to bring together and collectively iterate on the knowledge and breakthroughs of the best projects on cryptocurrency price prediction using the power of the crowd.

The projects listed here are all members of the AlgoHive Project, a [community](https://algohive.com/) of data scientists, machine experts, crypto traders, financial analysts, and angel investors that are working together to help make cryptocurrency trading safer, smarter and easier.

> *We love algorithms, crypto, machine learning and AI and work together to ultimately develop the most predictive cryptocurrency algorithm in the world.*

This includes:

* Social sentiment data
* Google Trends
* CCXT Library
* GitHub data
* Reddit data
* Deep learning models
* ...more data sources explored and assimilated weekly

There are many practical real-world use cases for leveraging machine learning/AI/predictive algorithms for use with crypto and financial markets in general. AlgoHive hopes to bring these ideas closer to reality not by one person or small private team but with a scalable crowdsourced model that has never been attempted in this capacity.

AlgoHive is harnessing the power of the crowd for a more distibuted intellengence to solve some of the most challenging problems in the world--starting with predicting the volatile crypto markets.

## Roadmap
***Q4 2018:***
- [x] Launch first community-backed project crypto prediction project (Crypto_signal: see index below for detail)
- [x] Launch website for attracting talent to our project (AlgoHive.com)
- [x] Launch community collaboration platform (Note: Will be moving to Discord due to the fact that we've now outgrown Telegram
- [ ] Move to Discord for more granular community management, role assignments and more scalable taxonomy
- [ ] AlgoHive Public Wallet (initial funding via donations--see detail below)
- [ ] Goal of **20** crypto predictive projects in the AlgoHive portfolio on community projects

***Q1 2019:***
- [ ] Release 2019 funding plan (to include costs for community growth, project funding, dedicated staff, etc.)
- [ ] Move repo to a paid GitHub organizational plan with role assignments
- [ ] Partnerships with data providers to provide all AlgoHive members with free access to premium data

***Q2 - Q4 2019:***

## What's in it for you:

- Get free advice from our community of members that live and breathe algorithms, data science, machine learning and the latest techniques in crypto trading and analysis.
- Learn about the benefits of leveraging machine learning and data-driven approaches (beyond just TA and FA) to cryptocurrency trading, trade automation and bot creation, and other smart programmatic ways to put your trading on autopilot.
- Full transparency into how we build crypto trading algorithms and bots, all of our research, field testing, expert analyses and yes, even failures (because we're all here to learn)! ðŸš€

## How to contribute:
1) Join our free [Telegram group](https://t.me/algohive) (100+ members from all over the world)

2) Share this repository link with others who think that this is cool project to be a part of.

3) Fork this repository to add other great crypto prediction projects to our master list.

## Why is this free?
After creating my original [Bitcoin trading formula](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-created-a-bitcoin-trading-algorithm-with-a-29-return-rate-using-sentiment-analysis-b0db0e777f4) that generated a 29% return using Google Trends sentiment analysis I shared  with the crypto community the response was overwhelming. So many others wanted to learn how to be smarter about crypto trading. After many, many conversations with other traders and data experts I discovered that many of us are actually trying to solve the same problem. This led me to build a collabortive platform to bring other great crypto minds together and launch the AlgoHive project and community.

This is free because this is the resource that *I would have loved to have years ago* but unfortunately I needed to learn it all by myself, make many *costly* mistakes and had no one to share my ultimate successes with.

>***I believe that information should be free, borderless and available to all.***

## Who's paying for all of this?
Although this is mostly a collaborative approach all the expenses of research, web development, web hosting, community management, developing and testing new algorithms, finding data sources I pay for out-of-pocket. While I want to forward the crypto movement the only way that this will be sustainable in the beginning is via donations.

To that end I am creating an AlgoHive public wallet (crypto donations)  which will be publicly viewable by anyone. While a portion of funds will be used for expenses the majority will be used primarily on growing this community and project--and hlping to accelerate the most promising projects. Anyone will be able to see real-time any funds used. Ultimately I will align project goals to a crowdfunding initiative for continued project development. 

Although crypto donations are very welcome, we also highly value community contributions. There will ALWAYS be a way that you can contribute even if that means volunteering your time and expertise.

(I am open to any other ideas that can ensure that funding is transparent and safe--please shoot me a note on [Telegram] (https://t.me/directbus) if you would like to help.
